This repository is composed of various utils I used to learn how neural nets work and create datasets which can be used to train neural networks and fine-tune OpenAI models from Discord messages downloaded in JSON format.

Since I have not originally planned to release this, the code is unorganized, not user-friendly, and not documented. I may however fix this later on, and combine most tools into one.

The most useful thing here is openAiDatasetTarget.py, which facilitates the creation of OpenAI prompts & completions to make AI versions of your Discord friends based on how they reply to other people.
